-- Higher Level Abstractions from IEEE Week --

Qiskit Functions and Qiskit Addons are attempts to provide some end-to-end workflows for specific use cases.  There is also an Algorithms package in the main Qiskit library.  Qiskit circuits interop with QASM.

Q-Ctrl can take a QASM circuit and optimize it.  

Munich Quantum Toolkit provides some abstractions and tooling and can interop with QASM.

Rustiq is a Python later on circuit generators written in Rust.  It has a small set of convenience functions.  Its unclear what the output to QASM would be, or if the conveniences are worth the effort.  

Qrisp has data types, arrays, and means to load data into quantum systems, as well as a small set of algorithms.  It can output to QASM.

Google Qualtran models algorithmic blocks with interconnecting wires, and provides a means to estimate runtime cost.  It can output to Cirq, and Cirq can output to QASM.

Classiq also has a high-level algorithmic expression in Python, GUI tools, and an export to QASM.

Two tools - qusetta and quasar from https://github.com/qcware provide a direct means to translate Qiskit to Cirq, and includes their own higher-level algorithm representation and estimator.

Its completely unclear how to get Q# to interop with QASM.
