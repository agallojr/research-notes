-- Workflow Community Summit, Sept 3-4, DaSilva, Chard et al --

Da Silva: 
    - AI suggests data plane must rise to level of control plane
    - heterogeneous in the control plane - e.g. quantum
    - multi-site 
    - toolchain support for portability 

Haus: 
    - data movement: inside a workflow, across-sites 
    - provenance with AI 
    - Git everywhere? object stores?  

Ward (Argonne):
    - interconnected labs - still seeing silos
    - heterogeneous (AI + HPC)
    - multi-site data movement is onerous - compression? pre-curated?

Carol Goble: (in the chat)
    - life sciences using EU ELIXIR
    - RO-CRATES for provenance 

Multi-Site Workflow breakout:
    - CWL for workflow description
    - Docker used, but not uniformly - need to bury that complexity
    - domain-specific standards for exec, for data, for provenance, etc.
    - transformations between different end user formats, some set of canonical interop formats (e.g. PSI/J for execution, CWL, etc.)
    - metadata "standards", ways to mine metadata from unstructured data 

Day Two:
    - Carol on FAIR, standing committee, writing a paper
    - UI/UX not a lot of traction or interest
    + heterogeneous breakout room
        - need interfaces / standards with reference implementations
        - interoperability via interchange of exposed end-user formats
        - psi-j one example of an interface, for one aspect of the complete workflow system
        - "not invented here" problem
        - "black box" problem with error reporting, user logs, provenance,etc.
        - composability of workflows, components within workflows - interop via metadata
        - dimensions of heterogeneity - within job, within enterprise, across sites

Summary of Workflow Community Summit:

1. Key Themes:
   - Data plane importance in control plane
   - Heterogeneous computing (including quantum)
   - Multi-site workflows and data movement
   - Toolchain support for portability
   - AI integration in workflows and provenance

2. Challenges:
   - Interconnected labs still facing silos
   - Onerous multi-site data movement
   - Complexity in containerization (e.g., Docker)
   - "Not invented here" problem
   - "Black box" issue with error reporting and logging

3. Proposed Solutions:
   - CWL for workflow description
   - RO-CRATES for provenance
   - Domain-specific standards for execution, data, and provenance
   - Transformations between user formats and canonical interop formats
   - Metadata standards and mining from unstructured data

4. Focus Areas:
   - FAIR principles
   - Interfaces and standards with reference implementations
   - Interoperability via interchange of exposed end-user formats
   - Composability of workflows and components
   - Dimensions of heterogeneity (within job, enterprise, across sites)

5. Notable Mentions:
   - PSI/J as an example interface
   - EU ELIXIR in life sciences
   - Limited traction on UI/UX aspects

Overall, the summit highlighted the need for standardization, interoperability, and solutions for multi-site, heterogeneous workflows in the scientific computing community.

Notes on ORNL report

Time Sensitive: benchmarks, data movement, data provenance, cross-site portable workflows

AI & HPC: cross-site portable workflows, data provenance, benchmarks, workflow optimization, scaling requirements 

Multi-facility: framework, multi-site requirements, site-aware planning, data cleansing, quantum sites 

Heterogeneous HPC: resource framework, workflow optimization, benchmarks, AI assist

UX: UX requirements, training, adaptive UX, AI assist

FAIR: data provenance, benchmarks, tool requirements


Requirements: 
    - a multi-faceted study, prioritized, iterative, informed by the real needs of other efforts (below)
    - ranked for end-state & near-term achievable plateaus
    - incl: functional, performance / benchmarks, for scale-up, to be multi-site portable, to be provenancial, UX

Data Provenance:
    - based on general requirements, likely pre-existing, assess the existing leading solutions (e.g. RO-CRATE)
    - also based on above, assess portability of approach across scientific domains 
    - based on that, championed by the leading tool team, pilot use of approach to another scientific domain (e.g. HEP)
    - (not in scope: reproducibility of results, preservation of execution environments, etc. - purely data metadata)

Cross-Site Portable Workflows: 
    - based on iterative general requirements, is there an existing implementation-agnostic framework?
    - above, also including job & site resource specifications
    - also including quantum sites 

Other: 
    - performant data movement
    - workflow optimization & planning 
    - data cleansing 
    - AI assist 
    - docs & training 


Plan / Org: 
    - steering group: recommends next steps across teams, seeks funding / air cover for the effort, publicizes results
    - requirements study group: govt / industry / edu, informed & prioritized by project plans of other efforts 
    - data provenance group: lead by leading tool team, goal to demonstrate cross-domain utility 
    - cross-site workflows group: 
    - other: other interest groups for other misc topics, above
    - (could combine steering & requirements, not count other for now, so three teams)
