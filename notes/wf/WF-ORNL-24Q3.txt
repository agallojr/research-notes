-- Workflow Community Summit, Sept 3-4, DaSilva, Chard et al --

Da Silva: 
    - AI suggests data plane must rise to level of control plane
    - heterogeneous in the control plane - e.g. quantum
    - multi-site 
    - toolchain support for portability 

Haus: 
    - data movement: inside a workflow, across-sites 
    - provenance with AI 
    - Git everywhere? object stores?  

Ward (Argonne):
    - interconnected labs - still seeing silos
    - heterogeneous (AI + HPC)
    - multi-site data movement is onerous - compression? pre-curated?

Carol Goble: (in the chat)
    - life sciences using EU ELIXIR
    - RO-CRATES for provenance 

Multi-Site Workflow breakout:
    - CWL for workflow description
    - Docker used, but not uniformly - need to bury that complexity
    - domain-specific standards for exec, for data, for provenance, etc.
    - transformations between different end user formats, some set of canonical interop formats (e.g. PSI/J for execution, CWL, etc.)
    - metadata "standards", ways to mine metadata from unstructured data 

Day Two
    - Carol on FAIR, standing committee, writing a paper
    - UI/UX not a lot of traction or interest
    + heterogeneous breakout room
        - need interfaces / standards with reference implementations
        - interoperability via interchange of exposed end-user formats
        - psi-j one example of an interface, for one aspect of the complete workflow system
        - "not invented here" problem
        - "black box" problem with error reporting, user logs, provenance,etc.
        - composability of workflows, components within workflows - interop via metadata
        - dimensions of heterogeneity - within job, within enterprise, across sites
