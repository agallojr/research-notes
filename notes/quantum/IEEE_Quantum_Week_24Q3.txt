IEEE Quantum Week
=================

Sunday 
    - different simulator types - state vector vs. tensor - which is better for CFD? other apps?
    - simulators can be optimized given deep understanding of problem space
    - e.g. QAOA sims are a discrete optimization of quantum annealing
    - sims are reaching the limit of usefulness - a 3-way connected network of 50 qubits is not simulatable
    - error in simulated solution can be considered noise, but simulating real environmental noise is different & hard
    - Google presentation on QEC still very low level 


Monday
    - variational algorithms are not quantum native
    - Gambetta: "1,000 qubits or your not doing quantum" (Heron is 133) <-- assume this means 1,000 virtual?
    - CLOPS as a metric - preparation, execution, measurement; scale of qubits, quality, (connectivity), speed 
    - applications for business in the 5 year time frame 
    - Masako emphasizes apps which model quantum systems, such as molecular biology
    - Qiskit is Python on Rust backend (performance to compete with cuQuantum)
    - circuits are DAGs, but normal UI DAG tools don't scale enough 
    - need to move from "research on quantum" to "research with quantum"
    - Qiskit Addons framework: map, optimize, execute, analyze - Addon plugins for each step 
    - Qiskit Functions - end-to-end workflow for specific applications, on-prem or cloud (serverless)
    - image segmentation: N pixels can be modeled in log(N) qubits, then use min cut; shows a NP-Hard problem in n recast as a QAOA problem in log(N)
    - IBM claims they do not publish road maps which are not achievable
    - Calcul Quebec SC site needs future framework for all accelerator types - fatelf plus?
    - remote gate control via entanglement


Tuesday
    - sizing of qubits for utility means QEC qubits - scientific advantage at 100 qubits, 1000 for commercial
    - Microsoft is focusing on apps for chemistry & materials science - both broadly impactful to a range of products
    - quantum apps can scale to high accuracy, but not be faster than classical with GPU acceleration
    - use quantum to generate data for AI 
    - (see screen shot of classical bounded above by quantum and below by AI) - referenced by others in the conference
    - security mitigation - use symmetric key or post-quantum public key 
    - Feynman: the world is quantum, dammit: use quantum to simulate quantum systems 


Wednesday
    - Its 1950 again, too soon for hardware abstraction, but not too soon to think about it
    - compilation: heuristics vs. optimization
    - gate selection: expressivity vs. calibration cost; same as RISC vs. CISC
    - Trotterization: discretization of time evolution of quantum systems; introduces algorithmic error; plus gate error
    - co-design still possible - considering both algorithm and gate selection, argument against too-early abstraction
    - HetArch: (see screen shot): like VLSI design, rules for scalable design; abstraction of some details, but still allows for modeling for example compute & storage on separate technologies 
    - quantum circuit cutting is not simple like classical modularity - there can be heavy restitching cost; tools to automate by statistical analysis of circuit structure the best cut points; can be orders of magnitude faster than default Qiskit behavior; cutting is similar to AI tensor problems, and thus QC can benefit from their investments
    - hands-on tutorial on LBM 
    - future state in-situ workflow using CPU, GPU, QPU, user won't know 
    - the universe computes, Heisenberg gives lower bound on time to flip a spin given an energy; delta x delta p >= h-bar / 2; delta t delta E >= h-bar / 2; blazing fast compared to classical; prepare the system then "massage the atoms to make them compute" (see Lloyd quote)
    - simulating quantum systems is still the best application of quantum computing - in other cases we will need to "rephrase the problem"
    - testing: how to test what is random?
    - at this conference, so much simultaneous innovation in so many different areas; hard to hit all the talks I want to see; hard to process all the information
    - software is research is result; current quantum software is research-driven; but reproducibility is aided by code centric work; also aided by tutorials and documentation; see the venn diagram with open source and open science; see JOSS
    - lots of collaboration and overlap in the community, but some efforts (tech, company, etc.) won't survive and will need to pivot (if you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
    - quantum programs will compile into multiple binaries and a workflow; LLVM is key to the pipeline; see also QIR, MLIR
    - lack of standards in workflows (by compute platform, by scientific domain) will inhibit QC adoption 
    - incorporating QC (and AI - how?) will change the entire stack; GPU is one example and it becomes an exception, but QC is a second example now demanding a pattern which will then enable neuromorphic, etc.  
    - Xanadu says "too soo for standards" - will iterate (fail) fast, work together
    

Thursday
    - IBM low level machine control takes QASM input and outputs machine controls - IBM is rewriting this part of the chain in Rust and removing the dependency on LLVM - much better performance without the "bloat" of LLVM but with a cost of portability which is not important for IBM-specific hardware drivers 
    - today's quantum programmer has to deal with lots of low level stuff - needs RSA + SME approach 
    - need better domain specific constructs to allow SME to speak in SME lingo 
    - code is research, code is result 
    - in software tech stack, need transparent layers to see and sometimes touch the layers below
    - model can be like OpenMP: programming -> execution -> hardware; we see circuits in the top two layers; we see QEC in the bottom two layers - layers are still blurry 
    - in Munich Quantum Toolkit, user SME can be shielded from some details for supported SME domain - specify requirements, parameters, validation cases; who builds SME domain? (the RSA), and will the abstraction be useful for new research?
    - RSA and SME likely work in different languages, and via iterative communication converge on useful software and obtain results 
    - Qualtran allows building of algorithms with "bloqs" of code, encapsulated functions with input and output wires; can thus reuse DAG tools; (visual programming like in LabVIEW?); wires can have data types, can explode out the abstractions if desired 
    - in quantum it can be useful to retain information about the high level code (e.g. domain info) to be used in lower level compiler optimizations; as compared with classical where most meta info is immediately removed by the compiler; e.g. noticing we are transposing a matrix twice resulting in a no-op, versus trying to optimize doing a transpose twice; "progressive lowering" of the abstractions 
    - Qrisp is strong typed; system function oriented; e.g. see Shor's algorithm in Qrisp; use in hybrid / variational algorithms; JISP = JAX + Qrisp 
    - Qrisp stack uses: Qrisp -> JAX -> Catalyst -> MLIR -> LLVM / QIR -> hybrid backend 
    - Fraunhofer not using MQT (but has pressure to do so)
    - should we limit discussion of workflow to a specific scientific domain (at least), and then only manage the variation by compute platform?
    - Quantum Machines approach to HPC and QC integration is to slave the QC to the HPC node / job with a fast interconnect; no workflow knowledge of the QC; currently only works with Grace Hopper  
    - is this the opportunity for us to take CPU / GPU / QPU / NPU into a single workflow system? (LLVM-based) common compiler stack?
    - if we can limit to a domain, can we enable LLM assist?
    - consider Hamiltonian as a surrogate representing the design space; finding optimum by QUBO solves the design problem; DQAOA = HPC + QAOA for exploring larger multi-variate design spaces (at GE, could we demonstrate with QAOA on simulator? GE Vernova interest?)
    - because current circuit code is small, investment in a Python layer is small and reversible
    - (porting to Rust vs. using Safe C++ - tradeoffs) 
    - Catalyst - running PennyLane code generates QASM which can then be optimized (even by third party - see Q-CTRL) and compiled to low level machine code; (is this model the same for Qiskit?)
    - end state: one code, multiple binaries and a workflow  
    - when working with a QC problem ask: at what scale, fidelity, time frame, frequency of need 
    - Quantinuum planning new machine in 5 years... MS and Atom... what is the size of their machine?  one should still likely consider the hardware to be far off 
    - "The pace of change has never been this fast, and it will never be this slow again" - Justin Trudeau
